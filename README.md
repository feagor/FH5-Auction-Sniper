# Forza-Horizon-5-Auction-Buyout-Sniper

This is the first script using image matching (e.g., OpenCV) to create a much faster and more stable macro for sniping a variety of desired cars in the auction house. Rather than sniping single specific cars, this script aims at fully collection for this game.

Note: This script DOESN'T gaurantee 100% to snipe the auctions. Due to network and other potential issues, you may run it for nothing or get quite a few cars within a long time.

This script is against [Forza Code of Conduct](https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/en-us/articles/360035563914-Forza-Code-of-Conduct#:~:text=Forza%20Code%20of%20Conduct%201%20The%20Driver%E2%80%99s%20Code,Suspensions%2FBanning%20...%204%20Appeals%20...%205%20Reporting%20), Use it as YOUR OWN RISK!

## Performance Preview (2MIN Demo)

In this demo, we let the script snipe these four cars `AUDI RS`, `AUDI R1`, `MEGANE R26 R`, `MINI COUNTRYMAN`.

## Pre-Requirements
1. System Requirements:

    This script only tests well on windows 10 with 1920*1080 (100% scale).

    ![system requirement](archive/system_setting.png)

2. Game setting: 
    
    I am using [Hyper-V](https://github.com/jamesstringerparsec/Easy-GPU-PV), a GPU Paravirtualization on Windows like virtual box on MacOS. Therefore, the HDR setting shows wired here. But it doesn't matter.

    To save energy and gpu cost, strongly suggest to set "VERY LOW" in grahic setting.
